Caveman Cosmonaut is a sample library for Plogue Sforzando version 1.961 or newer. It contains samples of an Unitra B-11 transistor organ, turned into a virtual analog synthesizer rather than an attempt at replicating the limitations of the original instrument. 

To register the Sforzando bank, drag the Caveman Cosmonaut.bank.xml file onto the Sforzando interface. Once registered, the instrument will be available in the Sforzando loading menu and the GUI will work.
